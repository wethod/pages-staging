 Percentage of external costs;
 Category;
 Probability.
  Pipeline has three subsections: Basket, Projects and Programs.
Basket The Basket contains all the project’s opportunity that are not well-defined yet. You can see it as a place where to put all the ideas that you usually write on a notebook or on a Post-It.</description>

      <description>Overview The budget is the place where you try to define (for a project):
 How many people you need;
 Which experience level you need;
 Which tasks are needed to get the job done;
 Who will do what;
 The external costs;
 The selling price.
  Done? Now the budget must be approved by a supervisor and, once approved, the project manager can start planning and creating orders.</description>

      <description>Overview The planning is useful to look at teammates availability, allocate them for projects and check that you respect the budget quota.
You can plan a person by half-days: we think it&amp;rsquo;s not worth planning by more fine-grained amounts of time. If your tasks require less time, just group them!
You cannot plan people for the current day: if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you have to do when you arrive at the office, how can you be productive?</description>

      <description>Overview WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project&amp;rsquo;s progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.
Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
 Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects; Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.   Timesheet At the end of each week, type in here the actual hours you&amp;rsquo;ve spent working on the projects you are involved in.</description>

      <description>Overview Project Report Each Monday, utilising data provided by Project Status, Timesheet and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.
Budget Consumption The Budget Consumption Report is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.
Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.</description>

      <description>Pipeline Value This is the total estimated value of the pipeline&amp;rsquo;s projects, weighted on their probability.
Project Status Valore che indica la stima a finire per un certo progetto. In pratica esprime il numero di giorni mancanti alla fine del progetto.
Production Value Valore che indica &amp;ldquo;quanto un progetto ha prodotto&amp;rdquo; ovvero la percentuale di completamento * il valore del progetto. Ad esempio: un progetto con project status al di 40 su 100 giornate (gliene mancano 40 alla fine) e con valore 10K avrà production value = 10K * ((100 - 40)/100).</description>
